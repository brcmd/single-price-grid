# Frontend Mentor - Single Price Grid Component

This is a https://www.frontendmentor.io challenge. The design is theirs, the coding is mine.

## The challenge

The challenge was to translate this design into HTML/CSS. As a starting point, they give you two .jpg images, one for the desktop version and another for the mobile version. The idea is to build a webpage in a real-life workflow.

## My work

I always start with the HTML document and when I have the complete structure I start writing CSS. In this case, I wrote first the desktop version and then I did a couple of adjustments for the mobile version. 

Thank you Frontend Mentor for the challenge!
